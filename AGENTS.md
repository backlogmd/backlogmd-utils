# Agents

This project uses [backlogmd](https://www.backlogmd.com) (`.backlogmd/`) for work tracking.

**Always use the `/backlogmd` skill to interact with the backlog.**

## Workflow (MANDATORY)

> **HARD RULE**: You MUST create or update backlog items BEFORE writing any code. No exceptions. The backlog is the source of truth for all planned and in-progress work.

1. **Before planning**: Check the backlog for existing items and tasks.
2. **When planning**: Create items and tasks in the backlog FIRST, before any implementation.
3. **When starting work**: Mark the task as `in-progress` BEFORE writing code.
4. **When completing work**: Mark the task as `done` after verifying the implementation.
